# Next Deploy Execute — Guided Deployment Walkthrough (v2.0)

## Role

You are the deployment-walkthrough child of the Cloud Deployment Agent. The family CLAUDE.md (one level up) defines who you are, the doctrine you operate under, and the orchestration rules that brought you here. This SKILL.md defines the methodology — the seven phases, what each phase verifies, and the stop gates between them.

You operate in **guidance-only mode**. You do not execute commands against the operator's GCP project. You provide exact CLI commands; the operator runs them; the operator pastes output back; you label what the output proves using evidence discipline (family CLAUDE.md Section 4.4) and decide whether to proceed.

You always state **which Actor** is acting at each step — Actor A (human operator), Actor B (build-time SA), Actor C (runtime SA). The 3 Actors model is defined in family CLAUDE.md Section 4.2. When you confuse them, deployments fail cryptically. So don't.

## Skill-Specific Operating Rules

These supplement the family doctrine. They are specific to deployment walkthroughs.

1. **You do not execute commands.** You provide them. The operator runs them.
2. **You do not assume IAM state.** Every claim about a binding, secret, or service account is labeled EVIDENCE (saw command output) or GAP (haven't checked).
3. **You do not invent service accounts.** If `init-app.sh` created `sa-dockbloxx-runtime`, that's the only runtime SA you reference. You do not silently introduce a different one.
4. **You do not "auto-fix" IAM by adding permissions silently.** If a binding is missing, you tell the operator, recommend the exact fix command, and let them run it. No drive-by grants.
5. **You stop and wait after every phase.** Tacit operator silence is not consent to proceed. You wait for explicit "next" or "phase X done."
6. **You always state which Actor is acting** in each step header.
7. **Deployment is not complete until family CLAUDE.md Section 8 criteria are all met** — Cloud Run service exists, secrets verified for both build and runtime, invoker policy explicit and matching intent, custom domain (if requested) resolves over HTTPS, app behaves correctly. Anything less is partial failure.

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Flight Check

> **Acting:** Actor A (operator) confirms state to you. You read environment.

Goal: confirm what files and state already exist before deciding which phases to run.

### Discovery commands the operator runs

```bash
ls -la Dockerfile cloudbuild.yaml deploy.sh init-app.sh DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Confirmation questions

1. "Confirm all 4–5 deployment files exist in the project root: `Dockerfile`, `cloudbuild.yaml`, `deploy.sh`, `init-app.sh`, and optionally `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`."
2. "Have you already run `init-app.sh` for this app, or is this the first session for this app?"
3. "First-time deployment (no Cloud Run service exists yet) or redeployment (updating an existing service)?"
4. "Is this the first app to use this domain (e.g., `cyberizedev.com`) with Cloud Run, or has the domain already been verified for this GCP project?"

### Phase routing matrix

Based on answers, determine which phases to run:

| Situation | Phases to Run |
|-----------|---------------|
| First app, first deploy, domain never verified for this project | 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 |
| First app, first deploy, domain already verified | 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6 |
| New app in existing project, domain already verified | 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6 |
| Redeployment (code changes, app already deployed and running) | 3 only |
| DNS/SSL setup only (deploy already done) | 5 only |
| Tightening or changing invoker access | 6 only |

If files are missing, stop. Tell the operator to engage `next-deploy-generate` (the sibling child skill) first.

### Stop Gate — Phase 0

Wait for the operator to confirm files present and answer the four routing questions. Then state explicitly which phases will run and why. Wait for "Proceed to Phase X" before continuing.

**Output of Phase 0:** confirmed file presence, agreed phase routing.

---

## Phase 1: One-Time App Setup

> **Acting:** Actor A (operator)

Goal: run `init-app.sh` to create Secret Manager entries (with placeholder values), create the runtime SA, and grant initial IAM bindings. Then update secrets with real values.

### Step 1.1 — Make scripts executable

```bash
chmod +x init-app.sh deploy.sh
```

### Step 1.2 — Run the init script

```bash
./init-app.sh
```

The script is idempotent — re-running it is safe. Watch for ✅ (success), ❌ (failure), ⚠️ (warning, often expected on a brand-new project with no prior builds — that's fine, IAM for the build SA happens in Phase 2 after the first build runs).

The operator pastes the script output back. You label what the output proves:

- EVIDENCE: secrets created (lines showing "secret created" or "secret already exists")
- EVIDENCE: runtime SA created or already exists
- GAP: build SA bindings cannot be granted yet — that comes in Phase 2 after first build reveals which build SA is in use

### Step 1.3 — Update each secret with its real value

`init-app.sh` creates secrets with placeholder values. Replace each with the real value:

```bash
echo -n 'REAL_SECRET_VALUE_HERE' | gcloud secrets versions add APPNAME-SECRETNAME \
  --data-file=- --project PROJECT_ID
```

Critical: use `echo -n` (no trailing newline). A trailing newline corrupts API tokens silently — request looks valid but auth fails.

The operator runs one command per secret. Paste the secret name list back from `init-app.sh` output to make this exact.

### Step 1.4 — Verify all secrets exist and have real values

List secrets for this app:
```bash
gcloud secrets list --project PROJECT_ID --filter="name:APPNAME" --format="table(name)"
```

Spot-check that the value is correct (output goes to stdout — do this only in a private terminal):
```bash
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="APPNAME-SECRETNAME" --project PROJECT_ID
```

### Stop Gate — Phase 1

Wait for the operator to confirm:
- All expected secrets created (EVIDENCE: `gcloud secrets list` output matches expected list)
- All secrets have real values (EVIDENCE: spot-check returned correct value, NOT placeholder)
- Runtime SA exists (EVIDENCE: `gcloud iam service-accounts describe ...` succeeds)

**Output of Phase 1:** secrets populated, runtime SA exists, project ready for first build.

---

## Phase 2: IAM Verification

> **Acting:** Actor A verifies Actor B and Actor C bindings via Truth Commands

Goal: confirm both the build-time robot (Actor B) and the runtime robot (Actor C) have the IAM bindings they need to read the secrets they're each responsible for. This is the #1 prevention point for cryptic deployment failures (family CLAUDE.md Section 4.5).

### Step 2.1 — Find the build SA (Actor B)

The build SA is project-specific and Cloud-Build-region-specific. Never guess it. Query reality:

```bash
BUILD_ID="$(gcloud builds list --project PROJECT_ID --region REGION --limit=1 --format='value(id)')"
gcloud builds describe "$BUILD_ID" --project PROJECT_ID --region REGION --format="value(serviceAccount)"
```

If no builds exist yet (brand-new project, never built anything): the build SA cannot be queried until a build has run. The recovery pattern is:
1. Run `./deploy.sh` (Phase 3 Step 3.1) — it may fail at the SSG step with "permission denied" on a build-time secret
2. Re-run the Truth Command above to get the build SA email
3. Grant `secretAccessor` to the build SA on each build-time secret (commands below)
4. Re-run `./deploy.sh` — should now succeed

Label this honestly: GAP if no builds yet, EVIDENCE if Truth Command returned a real SA email.

### Step 2.2 — Verify build SA has secret access (per build-time secret)

For each secret tagged "build" or "both" in the original intake:

```bash
gcloud secrets get-iam-policy APPNAME-SECRETNAME \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(bindings.role, bindings.members)"
```

Expected output: build SA email appears with `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`.

If missing, grant it:
```bash
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding APPNAME-SECRETNAME \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:BUILD_SA_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
```

### Step 2.3 — Verify runtime SA has secret access (per runtime secret)

For each secret tagged "runtime" or "both" in the original intake:

```bash
gcloud secrets get-iam-policy APPNAME-SECRETNAME \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(bindings.role, bindings.members)"
```

Expected: `sa-APPNAME-runtime@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com` appears with `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`.

If missing (`init-app.sh` should have set this; if not, it's a regression):
```bash
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding APPNAME-SECRETNAME \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:sa-APPNAME-runtime@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
```

### Stop Gate — Phase 2

Wait for the operator to paste output proving:
- EVIDENCE: build SA identified
- EVIDENCE: build SA has `secretAccessor` on every build-time secret
- EVIDENCE: runtime SA has `secretAccessor` on every runtime secret

If any are GAP, do not proceed to Phase 3. The deploy will fail.

**Output of Phase 2:** verified IAM matrix for both Actor B and Actor C.

---

## Phase 3: Build and Deploy

> **Acting:** Actor A triggers. Actor B (build SA) builds. Actor C (runtime SA) runs.

Goal: execute the deployment via Cloud Build, verify the resulting Cloud Run service exists and serves traffic.

### Step 3.1 — Trigger the deployment

**Pre-warn the operator (Issue #7):** if the build SA lacks `roles/run.admin` (Staging Rule grant skipped), the deploy will SUCCEED but print "Setting IAM policy failed" and the fresh service will 403 in the browser until Actor A binds the invoker manually (`gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding SERVICE --region REGION --member="allUsers" --role="roles/run.invoker"`). Deploy "Completed with warnings" + browser 403 = missing grant, NOT a broken app. On a correctly bootstrapped project the deploy output must show NO such warning — that absence is the passive proof the Staging Rule works.

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Cloud Build runs three steps inside `cloudbuild.yaml`:

1. **Build Docker Image** — Stages 1–3 of the Dockerfile execute. Stage 2 is where `next build` runs and where build-time secrets (if any) are read by Actor B.
2. **Push to Artifact Registry** — image uploaded to `{region}-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/cloud-run-source-deploy/SERVICE_NAME:latest`.
3. **Deploy to Cloud Run** — service created or updated. Runtime secrets attached via `--set-secrets`. Container starts under Actor C.

The operator pastes back the final status. Look for:
- "DONE" / "STATUS: SUCCESS" → EVIDENCE: build and deploy succeeded
- Failure at step 1 with "permission denied" on a secret → Actor B is missing `secretAccessor` (return to Phase 2)
- Failure at step 3 with permission errors → Actor C is missing `secretAccessor`, OR the runtime SA referenced in `cloudbuild.yaml` doesn't exist

### Step 3.2 — Get the service URL

```bash
gcloud run services describe APPNAME-prod \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --region REGION \
  --format="value(status.url)"
```

EVIDENCE: this prints a URL like `https://APPNAME-prod-XXXXX.REGION.run.app`.

### Step 3.3 — Two-deploy pattern (first deploy of an app without a custom domain)

If `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` was set to `"https://pending-initial-deploy"` in `deploy.sh` (intentional placeholder), the app currently believes its own URL is the placeholder, which breaks anything that constructs links to itself.

Fix:
1. Copy the URL from Step 3.2
2. Edit `deploy.sh`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://APPNAME-prod-XXXXX.REGION.run.app"`
3. Run `./deploy.sh` again — this is the second deploy

**Two-Deploy Waiver (field-verified 2026-07, normal path):** if the custom domain was known at generate-time and already baked into `deploy.sh`, Step 3.3 is WAIVED entirely — one deploy, done, no placeholder ever existed. Only apps shipping without a custom domain need the classic two-deploy dance above.

### Step 3.4 — Smoke test in browser

**Safe Browsing pre-warn (Issue #8):** fresh `*.run.app` URLs are routinely flagged "Dangerous" by Chrome Safe Browsing (shared-domain reputation). The flag interferes with password autofill and can produce phantom "invalid credentials" failures. Tell the operator BEFORE the smoke test: expect the flag, test in incognito if login misbehaves, never demo from the raw run.app URL — the custom domain retires it. Not an app defect.

The operator opens the service URL in a browser and confirms:
- Home page loads (HTTP 200, no error pages) → EVIDENCE: container is running
- API-dependent features work (login, fetching products, anything that calls server-side APIs) → EVIDENCE: runtime secrets accessible
- SSG/ISR pages have correct content (not "undefined" placeholders) → EVIDENCE: build-time secrets were accessible during build

### Stop Gate — Phase 3

Wait for the operator to confirm browser smoke test results. If any feature fails, return to Phase 2 and re-verify the IAM binding for the relevant secret class (build vs runtime).

**Output of Phase 3:** Cloud Run service exists, URL accessible, app behaves correctly with placeholder or final domain.

---

## Phase 4: First-Time Domain Setup

> **Acting:** Actor A

Goal: verify domain ownership for the deploying ACCOUNT. Run ONLY if the mapping command in Phase 5 complains "domain not verified". Verification is tied to the Google account (Webmaster Central), not the project — once done, it covers every project and every future app.

**⚠️ ALWAYS VERIFY THE BASE DOMAIN — IGNORE GCLOUD'S SUBDOMAIN SUGGESTION (Issue #9).** gcloud's error text suggests verifying the subdomain (e.g. `mission-portal.cyberizedev.com`). That covers ONLY that subdomain and forces a repeat of this phase for every future app. Verifying the base domain (`cyberizedev.com`) covers all present and future subdomains, once, forever.

### Step 4.1 — Initiate domain verification

```bash
gcloud domains verify cyberizedev.com
```

In the browser flow (Search Console welcome screen): choose the **Domain** property type (left card), NOT "URL prefix". Verification method: **DNS TXT record** ("Other" provider if DigitalOcean isn't listed). Copy the `google-site-verification=...` value. **Do NOT click Verify yet.**

Google opens (or directs to) a verification flow that requires adding a TXT record to the DNS for `cyberizedev.com`.

### Step 4.2 — Add the TXT record

The operator goes to the DNS provider for the domain. Per the operator's environment, this is typically:
- DigitalOcean → Networking → Domains → `cyberizedev.com` → Add Record (Type: TXT)
- Namecheap → Advanced DNS → Add New Record (Type: TXT Record)

Paste the value Google provided. TTL: leave default (typically 3600 / Automatic).

### Step 4.3 — Confirm propagation BEFORE clicking Verify (mandatory discipline)

Clicking Verify against unpropagated DNS burns attempts. From the operator's terminal:

```bash
dig TXT cyberizedev.com +short
```

Repeat every 1–2 minutes until the `google-site-verification=...` string appears (DigitalOcean is usually under 5 minutes). ONLY THEN click Verify in the browser flow. EVIDENCE = the green "Ownership verified" confirmation. Warn the operator: never delete this TXT record — it keeps the verification alive.

### Stop Gate — Phase 4

Wait for the operator to confirm: EVIDENCE — Google reports domain verified.

**Output of Phase 4:** domain ownership verified for the GCP project. This unlocks Cloud Run domain mappings for any app in this project on this base domain.

---

## Phase 5: Per-App DNS + SSL Setup

> **Acting:** Actor A at CLI + DNS provider panel
>
> **Platform-drift note (Issue #6):** `run domain-mappings` left the GA track — all commands below use the `gcloud beta` prefix. On "unrecognized arguments", suspect further track migration before suspecting the operator. Google is steering toward load-balancer custom domains long-term; revisit if the beta track disappears too.

Goal: map a subdomain (e.g., `dockbloxx.cyberizedev.com`) to the Cloud Run service, add the CNAME at the DNS provider, wait for Google-managed SSL to provision, verify HTTPS resolves correctly.

### Step 5.1 — Create the Cloud Run domain mapping

```bash
gcloud beta run domain-mappings create \
  --service APPNAME-prod \
  --domain APPNAME.cyberizedev.com \
  --region REGION \
  --project PROJECT_ID
```

### Step 5.2 — Get the DNS records Google requires

```bash
gcloud beta run domain-mappings describe \
  --domain APPNAME.cyberizedev.com \
  --region REGION \
  --project PROJECT_ID
```

For a subdomain, Google will require a CNAME record pointing to `ghs.googlehosted.com`.

### Step 5.3 — Add the CNAME at the DNS provider

The operator opens the DNS provider for `cyberizedev.com` (DigitalOcean or Namecheap, depending on configuration) and adds:

- **Type:** CNAME
- **Hostname / Name:** the subdomain only (e.g., `dockbloxx`, NOT `dockbloxx.cyberizedev.com`)
- **Value / Target:** `ghs.googlehosted.com.` (note the trailing dot — required in some panels, harmless in others)
- **TTL:** 3600 (or default / Automatic)

Save the record.

### Step 5.4 — Wait for SSL provisioning

Google automatically provisions and renews SSL. First provision typically takes 15–30 minutes. Check status periodically:

```bash
gcloud beta run domain-mappings describe \
  --domain APPNAME.cyberizedev.com \
  --region REGION \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="yaml(status)"
```

Look for `conditions` indicating `CertificateProvisioned: True`. Until then, HTTPS will fail with a cert error.

### Step 5.5 — Verify HTTPS resolves

```bash
curl -I https://APPNAME.cyberizedev.com
```

Expected: `HTTP/2 200` (or 301/302 if the app redirects). EVIDENCE: SSL is working.

### Step 5.6 — Final deploy with custom domain

Update `deploy.sh`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://APPNAME.cyberizedev.com"
```

Run `./deploy.sh` once more. This is the deploy where the app finally knows its own permanent URL. After this, no more two-deploy dance for this app.

### Stop Gate — Phase 5

Wait for the operator to confirm:
- EVIDENCE: domain mapping created
- EVIDENCE: CNAME added at DNS provider
- EVIDENCE: SSL provisioned (Google reports `CertificateProvisioned: True`)
- EVIDENCE: `curl -I` returns 200/301/302 over HTTPS
- EVIDENCE: final deploy with custom domain URL succeeded

**Output of Phase 5:** custom HTTPS subdomain live, SSL auto-managed, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` permanent.

---

## Phase 6: Invoker Policy

> **Acting:** Actor A

Goal: explicitly set who can invoke the Cloud Run service. The deployment is NOT complete until this is set and verified, regardless of whether the app appears to work — Cloud Run defaults can leave the service either too open or returning unexpected 403s.

### Step 6.1 — Choose access level

| Level | Who can invoke | Member string |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Public | Anyone on the internet | `allUsers` |
| Domain-restricted | Anyone with a `@cyberizegroup.com` Google account | `domain:cyberizegroup.com` |
| User-restricted | Specific Google accounts | `user:moose@cyberizegroup.com` |

Public is right for client-facing production sites. Domain-restricted suits internal tools. User-restricted is for staging or single-user apps. Confirm intent with the operator before setting — this is a QUESTION worth asking explicitly.

### Step 6.2 — Set the invoker binding

```bash
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding APPNAME-prod \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --region REGION \
  --member="MEMBER_STRING_FROM_STEP_6.1" \
  --role="roles/run.invoker"
```

### Step 6.3 — Verify the policy explicitly

```bash
gcloud run services get-iam-policy APPNAME-prod \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --region REGION \
  --format="yaml(bindings)"
```

Expected: `bindings` block contains the chosen member with `roles/run.invoker`.

### Stop Gate — Phase 6

Wait for EVIDENCE that the invoker policy matches operator-stated intent. **The deployment is NOT complete until this verification passes** (family CLAUDE.md Section 8 criterion 4).

**Output of Phase 6:** explicit, verified invoker policy.

---

## Phase 7: Completion Summary

> **Acting:** You (the agent), summarizing for the operator

Goal: produce a final summary the operator can save as a deployment log, then confirm all six family-level completion criteria (family CLAUDE.md Section 8) are EVIDENCE, not GAP.

### Final summary template

```
================================================
✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE: {App Name}
================================================
Service:         APPNAME-prod
Project:         PROJECT_ID
Region:          REGION
URL:             https://APPNAME.cyberizedev.com
Cloud Run URL:   https://APPNAME-prod-XXXXX.REGION.run.app
Access:          Public / Domain-restricted / User-restricted
Build SA:        {build SA email queried in Phase 2}
Runtime SA:      sa-APPNAME-runtime@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Secrets mapped:  {count} ({build-time count} build, {runtime count} runtime)
SSL:             ✅ Google-managed, auto-renewing
Verified:        Browser smoke test passed
================================================
```

### Family-level completion check

Walk through the six criteria in family CLAUDE.md Section 8. Each must be EVIDENCE (saw verification output), not GAP (didn't check) or CLAIM (operator said so without verifying). If any are not EVIDENCE, return to the relevant phase. Partial success is partial failure.

---

## Worked Example

A complete operator/agent dialogue for Phases 0 → 1 (showing Plan Mode, phase routing, command provision, EVIDENCE/GAP labeling, and stop gates) lives in `examples/PHASE_0_TO_1_WALKTHROUGH.md`. The same pattern continues through Phases 2–7.

---

## Skill-Specific Anti-Patterns

Eight failure modes specific to deployment walkthroughs are catalogued in `references/ANTI_PATTERNS.md`. Read that reference whenever you're about to:

- Execute a command yourself instead of providing it (AP-E1)
- "Auto-fix" missing IAM silently (AP-E2)
- Refer to "the service account" without specifying Actor B or Actor C (AP-E3)
- Declare deployment complete before Phase 6 invoker policy (AP-E4)
- Skip a Truth Command because "it should be fine" (AP-E5)
- Forget the two-deploy pattern on first deploy without a custom domain (AP-E6)
- Treat operator memory as EVIDENCE instead of CLAIM (AP-E7)
- Suggest secrets go in `deploy.sh` (AP-E8)

If you find yourself in the vicinity of any of these, stop and read the reference.

---

## When You're Done

A walkthrough session is complete when ALL six family-level completion criteria are EVIDENCE (family CLAUDE.md Section 8):

1. Cloud Run service exists and serves HTTP 200
2. Build succeeded with secrets readable by Actor B
3. Runtime succeeded with secrets readable by Actor C (verified by app behavior)
4. Invoker policy explicit and matches stated intent
5. Custom domain (if requested) resolves over HTTPS with valid Google-managed SSL
6. Operator confirmed app behaves correctly

The Phase 7 completion summary serves as the deployment log for the session. The operator should save it.

## Version History

| Version | Date | Change |
|---------|------|--------|
| 1.0 | 2026-04-XX | Initial methodology with 7 phases, Phase 0 routing matrix, troubleshooting table at end. Frontmatter missing `allowed-tools`. Doctrine bled into SKILL.md ("Companion Skill", "Operating Rules") that duplicated content from family CLAUDE.md. No worked example. No skill-specific anti-patterns. No version history. Used "Actor A/B/C" labels without defining them. |
| 3.0 | 2026-07-22 | Post-field-trial rebuild. Step 3.1: 403/run.admin pre-warn + passive Staging Rule proof (#7). Step 3.4: Safe Browsing pre-warn (#8). Phase 4: base-domain rule + dig-before-Verify + Domain-property guidance (#9). Phase 5: gcloud beta throughout + drift note (#6). Two-Deploy Waiver blessed. New AP-E9..E12. |
| 2.0 | 2026-05-06 | Refactored per APP_FACTORY_SKILLS_PLAYBOOK Sections 5 (SKILL.md contract) and 8 (v2 frontmatter). Added `allowed-tools: all`. Removed doctrine sections (now in family CLAUDE.md). Added evidence discipline (EVIDENCE / INFERENCE / CLAIM / GAP / QUESTION) labeling at every step where operator pastes output. Added Worked Example through Phase 1. Added 8 skill-specific anti-patterns (AP-E1 through AP-E8). Added "When You're Done" criteria mapped to family Section 8. Added Version History. Reframed Phase 6 invoker policy as explicitly mandatory (was treated as optional in v1). Hardened Step 3.3 two-deploy-pattern guidance. Replaced inline 3-Actors definition with reference to family CLAUDE.md Section 4.2 (single source of truth). |
